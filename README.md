**Submarine Game** is a Unity project inspired by the classic *Flappy Bird* mechanics — but with a Beatles twist.  
Players guide a submarine through whimsical underwater obstacles, combining arcade-style gameplay with the surreal charm of Beatles-inspired worlds.  

The project takes inspiration from:  
- **Yellow Submarine** (1968 Beatles animated film)

Together, these influences create a colorful, dreamlike ocean adventure.

## Inspiration  
This project is a playful homage to:  
- **Yellow Submarine** → the Beatles’ animated film, famous for its psychedelic art style, surreal landscapes, and dreamlike sea creatures.  
- **Octopus’s Garden** → the Beatles’ song celebrating life under the sea, and one of the most joyful underwater anthems.  

Both influences merge into a whimsical, underwater arcade game experience.
